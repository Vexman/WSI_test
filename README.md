# Code test for West Elm

This was build using Pug markup and node.js to show off a little more of my skills and for ease of templating out pages, I avoided using jQuery or theme frameworks like Boilerplate.
I was planning on setting this up with react which would pull data from a JSON file(to simulate a database of content) and populate parts of the page such as the name, price, copy, data attributes and images but decided against that for time constraints.

There is a compiled version inside trunk and the precompiled markup is inside lib.

## To run the gulp process:
* User must have or install `Node.js`
* Navigate using Terminal or Command Line to the root of the folder containing the `package.json`
